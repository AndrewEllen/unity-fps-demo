### What was worked on yesterday

- I created buttons on the servers and settings menus

- I implemented scripts on the buttons to change between the menus

- I implemented a quit script on the quit button

- This completed the main menu

### What will be worked on today

- Today I will be working on getting the server menu complete and adding the ability to create and join lobbies

### What blockers are there

- I currently don't know how to do lobbies with the package we're using and I have limited experience in unity. Other than that none.
